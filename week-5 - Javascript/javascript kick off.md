# Javascript

## Goals
- Apply a process for learning a new language
- test drive a front end web app with JS

### Front end
```
  Client                            Server
  ------                            ------
  is front end                      is backend
  functionality on client side      code runs here

```

Ruby executes on server and returns html
JS can execute on either client or server - doesn't make it a front end app

### Front end apps
```
  Client                            Server
  ------                            ------
  All executed here here            sends back ALL files (css, js, html)

```
Pure front end - server always sends the same things

e.g.
if you want to show time, it will be the server time, vs client
