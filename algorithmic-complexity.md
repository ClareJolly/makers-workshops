# Algorithmic Complexity

## Algorithms

`A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.`

**input**

sequence of operations/steps that produce the desired outcome

**output**

- Language agnostic
- pseudo code
- idea under the code

`Series of steps and operations to get from one point to the desired outcome (input to output)`

## Complexity

`The amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute an algorithm`

- how many steps/iterations
- how slow (speed)
- memory usage

opposite of efficiency - want to try to decrease complexity

## Github project

- timing code
- readme with plotted graphs - linking to algorithms
- folder of algorithms written
