## Week 8 - tailor course to needs of employers

### Goals

** Be ready for placement **
- fundamentals of a new tech stack
  - Think back to earlier course on how we work with this - technical skills as well as team working
- working like a pro team
  - How do we know if it's working?  How do we know if our team is doing well?  What metrics can we use?

### Agile
