### Tools - should use to do what we need to do, not necessarily learn everything

* Sinatra

Internet = everything, FTP, SFTP, torrent, VOIP, email

WWW runs on the internet - pretty much just HTTP

```
Client - browser                                Server - websites


HTML
CSS
JS

IMG
VID
ETC
```


google.com/images - images is the route.
